# QUIZ

### 1. What is the relationship between actors and tasks?

Actors are basically the code that's being run based on some inputs. Predefined inputs can be saved into a task, so you don't have to type them out them every time.

### 2. What are the differences between default (unnamed) and named storage? Which one would you use for everyday usage?

Default (unnamed) storages are assigned to each actor run. Named storages are assigned to your account and can be easier to share across your actors because of their's specific names. For everyday actor run use the default storage, since there are no benefits in doing so with a named storage and you don't have to deal with some renaming issues of named storages.

### 3. What is data retention, and how does it work for all types of storages (default and named)?

By default, unnamed storages are deleted in 7 days. Named storages last forever.
